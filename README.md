 ## Scope

 Fils is a software project designed to ease the access to female hair styling assets. It's an insight aiming the mega-hair users community (the main costumers), hair salon owners e mega-hair professionals; as the latters been the main stakeholders.
 The scrum project was built having in mind a scrum team composed by:

 * Product Owner
 * Scrum Master
 * 3 software engineers


 ## Lean Inception

 The project was conceived using the [Lean Inception](https://caroli.org/lean-inception-3/) method, resulting in a feature sequence of approach, a MVP canvas and a MVP definition with 3 business increments of value. 

 The whole development proccess was documented in a Miro board available in this link: [Fils Lean Inception at Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKZPKR7I=/?share_link_id=746167656525)


 ## Scrum project

 With the feature approaching sequence and the MVP built, a product backlog was built using Jira Software with the following stats:

* 4 Epics
* 19 User Stories
* 347 Story Points

5 user stories were refined and detailed, acquiring some functional, non-functional and domain requirements, acceptance criteteria, DoR, DoD; originating the first project sprint plan, whose goal is the build of the app MVP.

Sprint backlog evidence can be found in file: [sprint-backlog.pdf](https://github.com/ivandomar/fils-project/blob/main/sprint-backlog.pdf)


## UI lo-fi prototype

Lastly, to support the users stories proposed in the first sprint, low fidelity user interface prototypes were developed using the Figma app.
